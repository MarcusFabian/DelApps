# Python Project Instructions

This is a Python project. When working with this codebase:

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write descriptive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project Structure
- Keep the main application code in the `src/` directory
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Keep requirements in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`

## Development Practices
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use logging instead of print statements for debugging
- Handle exceptions appropriately with try-catch blocks
- Follow the single responsibility principle for functions and classes
